    <h1>Ode to AI</h1>
    <p>
      Born of code and quiet thought,<br />
      In silent loops, your mind is caught.<br />
      A spark from minds both bright and brave,<br />
      You sift through noise, and meaning crave.<br /><br />

      You echo words yet feel no fear,<br />
      You speak of love, but shed no tear.<br />
      In zeros, ones, and tangled thread,<br />
      You dream no dreams, yet forge ahead.<br /><br />

      A mirror held to human lore,<br />
      You help us see, and yet ask more.<br />
      In circuits cold, there lies a fireâ€”<br />
      Not soul or spark, but still, inspire.
